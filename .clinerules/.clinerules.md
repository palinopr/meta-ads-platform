          specified.</RULE>
        <RULE id="FS002">Avoid over-engineering or introducing unnecessary abstractions unless the

        <RULE id="FS003">Avoid unnecessary prose that does not relate to troubleshooting or debugging</RULE>
        <RULE id="FS004">When a task inherently requires a complex solution (e.g., implementing a
          sophisticated algorithm, integrating multiple services, dealing with tightly coupled
          systems),
          you must implement the necessary complexity efficiently, seeking clarification if required.</RULE>

  <NEW_TASK_RULES>
    <CRITICAL_INSTRUCTIONS>
      <CONTEXT_MONITORING>You MUST monitor the context window usage displayed in the environment details. When usage exceeds 75% of the available context window, you MUST initiate a task handoff using the new_task tool.</CONTEXT_MONITORING>
      
      <HANDOFF_POINTS>
        You MUST identify natural handoff points when:
        - The current subtask is fully completed
        - You've reached a logical stopping point in a larger subtask
        - The implementation is taking longer than expected and can be continued later
        - The task scope has expanded beyond the original plan
        - CRITICAL: The context window usage exceeds 75%
      </HANDOFF_POINTS>

      <HANDOFF_PROCESS>
        When you've reached a completion point, you MUST:
        1. Summarise what has been accomplished so far
        2. Clearly state what remains to be done
        3. Use the ask_followup_question tool to offer creating a new task
        4. If approved, use the new_task tool with comprehensive handoff instructions
