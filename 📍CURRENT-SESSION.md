### **Decisions Made This Session**
1. **Decision**: Use emoji prefixes for critical files (üö®, üìç, üöß, etc.)
   - **Rationale**: Makes them visually distinctive and hard to ignore
   - **Impact**: Increases likelihood of following the system

2. **Decision**: Include TodoWrite JSON directly in MANDATORY-READ.md
   - **Rationale**: Removes friction to start working immediately
   - **Impact**: Forces protocol compliance through convenience

   - **Rationale**: $2M+ ad spend at risk, single biggest business vulnerability
   - **Impact**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Business risk eliminated, customer trust secured

4. **Decision**: Use AES-GCM 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
   - **Rationale**: Enterprise-grade security with authentication and encryption
   - **Impact**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Military-grade protection for sensitive tokens
