## 💡 **SESSION INSIGHTS & DISCOVERIES**

### **What's Working Well**
- Meta Ads Platform is stable and operational
- Cleanup was successful (100+ files removed)
- Clear focus on memory/progress system
- TodoWrite tool integration is smooth

### **Challenges Encountered**
- Need to balance completeness with simplicity in the tracking system
- Must ensure the system is actually self-enforcing, not just documented

### **Decisions Made This Session**
1. **Decision**: Use emoji prefixes for critical files (🚨, 📍, 🚧, etc.)
   - **Rationale**: Makes them visually distinctive and hard to ignore
   - **Impact**: Increases likelihood of following the system

2. **Decision**: Include TodoWrite JSON directly in MANDATORY-READ.md
   - **Rationale**: Removes friction to start working immediately
   - **Impact**: Forces protocol compliance through convenience
