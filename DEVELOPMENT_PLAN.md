### Phase 2: Authentication and Authorisation System

**Implementation Approach:**
Extend Supabase Auth with custom claims for agency/role context. Use middleware pattern for consistent authorization across all routes.

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- **Option 1: JWT with agency/role claims** ✓ - Stateless, scalable, works with RLS
- **Option 2: Session-based with Redis** - More complex, requires additional infrastructure
- **Option 3: Database lookup per request** - Performance overhead, not recommended

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (RLS policies must be in place)

- [ ] Extend Supabase Auth for multi-tenant support
  - [ ] Implement agency context middleware
    ```typescript
    // middleware.ts
    export async function withAgencyContext(req: Request) {
      const session = await getSession()
      const agencyContext = await getAgencyContext(session.user.id)
      // Inject into request headers for RLS
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Create session management for agency switching

  - [ ] Define permission matrix (Owner/Manager/Viewer)
    ```typescript
    const PERMISSIONS = {
      owner: ['*'], // all permissions
      manager: ['view', 'edit', 'export', 'invite_viewer'],
      viewer: ['view', 'export']
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Create permission checking hooks (`usePermission`)

## Architectural Principles & Constraints

### Core Principles

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Each agency owns their data completely
2. **Zero Trust Security**: Verify every request, trust nothing
3. **API-First Design**: All features accessible via API
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work everywhere
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System remains usable during failures

### Hard Constraints

**Never Violate These Rules:**
1. ❌ **NEVER store campaign data in database** - Always fetch from Meta API
2. ❌ **NEVER expose Meta API tokens to frontend** - Use Edge Functions
3. ❌ **NEVER allow cross-agency data access** - RLS must enforce
4. ❌ **NEVER skip authorization checks** - Every endpoint protected
5. ❌ **NEVER use synchronous blocking operations** - Async everything

### Coding Standards

**TypeScript Configuration:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  }
}
```

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
// Always use this pattern for components
export interface ComponentProps {
  // Props with JSDoc comments
}

export function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // Hooks at top
  // Early returns for edge cases
  // Main render
}
```

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```typescript
// Consistent error handling across codebase
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation()
  return { data: result, error: null }
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error, context })
  return { data: null, error: 'User-friendly message' }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

**Minimum Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: 80% coverage
- Integration Tests: All API endpoints
- E2E Tests: Critical user journeys
- Performance Tests: Before each release

**Test Patterns:**
```typescript
// Consistent test structure
describe('Feature', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  })

  it('should handle happy path', async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  })

  it('should handle error case', async () => {
    // Test error scenarios
  })
})
```
