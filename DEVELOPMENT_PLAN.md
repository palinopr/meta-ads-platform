# Development Plan for Internal Meta Ads Analytics Platform

## Project Purpose and Goals

**NEW VISION**: A lean internal analytics platform for 2-3 power users to analyze Meta ads trends and make fast optimization decisions.

**Primary Goals:**
- **Trend Analysis**: Age demographics, sales per day patterns, performance insights
- **Fast Decision Making**: Quick access to what's working vs what needs optimization
- **Simple UI**: No complexity, focused on essential analytics only
- **Real-time Data**: Always fresh insights from Meta API (no stale database cache)
- **Power User Experience**: Built for experts who know what they need

**Current Status:** Strategic pivot from complex SaaS to lean internal analytics tool - 70% complexity reduction achieved.

## Context and Background

**Platform Architecture (Simplified):**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (lean, fast loading)
- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions only (no complex FastAPI backend)
- Database: Ultra-minimal schema (profiles + meta_ad_accounts only)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with Facebook OAuth
- Meta API Integration: Direct API calls (no campaign data storage)

**Key Architecture Decision:** 
```
Frontend â†’ Edge Function â†’ Meta API (Direct)
NOT: Frontend â†’ Database â†’ Sync Job â†’ Meta API
```

**Database Strategy:**
- KEEP: User profiles, Meta account references only
- REMOVE: All campaign storage tables (campaigns, ads, metrics, etc.)
- PRINCIPLE: Always fetch fresh from Meta API

## Hard Requirements

1. **Speed**: Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds, insights available immediately
2. **Simplicity**: Single-page analytics dashboard, no complex navigation
3. **Accuracy**: Real-time Meta API data for trend analysis
4. **Focus**: Only essential analytics - age demographics, daily patterns, performance metrics
5. **Internal Tool**: Built for 2-3 expert users, not multi-tenant SaaS
6. **No Tools**: Pure analytics focus, no campaign management features

## Development Phases

  - Data prefetching
  - Progressive Web App features

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow (Simplified)
```
User Dashboard â†’ Edge Function â†’ Meta API â†’ Real-time Analytics
                      â†“
                Temporary Cache (5min TTL)
```

### Key APIs Needed
- **Meta Insights API**: Campaign performance, demographics, time series
- **Meta Campaigns API**: Basic campaign info for context
- **Meta Ad Account API**: Account selection and management

### Analytics Components Architecture
```
AnalyticsDashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ AgeDemographicTrends/
â”œâ”€â”€ DailySalesPattern/
â”œâ”€â”€ PerformanceComparison/
â”œâ”€â”€ OptimizationInsights/
â””â”€â”€ QuickMetrics/
```

## Success Metrics
