# Development Plan for Meta Ads Analytics Platform

## Project Purpose and Goals

The Meta Ads Analytics Platform is a comprehensive analytics and optimization platform managing $2M+ in Facebook advertising spend. The platform provides real-time analytics, campaign optimization, multi-client management, automated reporting, and budget management capabilities for advertising agencies and businesses.

**Primary Goals:**
- Protect and optimize $2M+ in advertising spend
- Provide enterprise-grade security and reliability
- Deliver real-time campaign analytics and insights
- Enable automated budget management and optimization
- Maintain competitive position in the ads management market

**Current Status:** 80% of CEO priorities completed with critical security, reliability, and core campaign management functionality operational in production.

## Context and Background

**Platform Architecture:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, deployed on Vercel
- Backend: Python FastAPI with Supabase Edge Functions
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with Facebook OAuth
- Meta API Integration: Direct API calls (no database caching)

**Completed Major Features:**
- âœ… Meta Access Token Encryption (AES-GCM 256-bit)
- âœ… API Rate Limiting with monitoring
- âœ… Comprehensive Error Monitoring (Sentry)
- âœ… Campaign CRUD Operations (Create, Update, Pause, Delete, Duplicate)
- âœ… Multi-account management (200+ ad accounts)
- âœ… Real-time campaign data fetching from Meta API

**Critical Architecture Decision:** Direct Meta API integration - no campaign data stored in database, always fresh from Meta API.

## Hard Requirements

1. **Financial Protection:** Real-time budget monitoring to prevent customer financial losses
2. **Security:** Enterprise-grade encryption for all Meta access tokens
3. **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime with comprehensive error monitoring
4. **Performance:** Dashboard load < 2 seconds, API responses < 500ms
5. **Scalability:** Support 100+ concurrent users without degradation
6. **Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA compliance for customer data
7. **Data Accuracy:** Real-time data from Meta API for million-dollar decisions

## Unknowns and Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Meta API rate limits remain stable at current levels
- Current Supabase plan scales to support expected user growth
- Facebook OAuth permissions remain unchanged
- Customer budget thresholds are configurable per account

**Unknowns:**
- Optimal alert notification timing for budget overruns
- Customer preferences for notification methods (email/SMS/in-app)
- Performance impact of real-time budget monitoring at scale
- Integration requirements with existing customer financial systems
