# Development Plan for Meta Ads Agency Platform

## Project Purpose and Goals

Transform the existing Meta Ads Analytics Platform into a **professional, enterprise-grade agency dashboard** that enables agencies to manage multiple clients, invite employees with role-based access, and provide comprehensive Meta API insights. The platform will serve as a white-label solution for digital marketing agencies managing $2M+ in ad spend across multiple client accounts.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Build a professional agency management system with employee invitation and role management
- Implement ALL available Meta API insights and analytics
- Create a modern, dark-themed interface that rivals Meta Ads Manager
- Establish multi-client management with granular permissions
- Provide real-time analytics dashboard with advanced reporting capabilities

## Context and Background

**Existing Infrastructure (KEEPING):**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend deployed on Vercel
- Supabase PostgreSQL database with authentication
- Meta API integration (App ID: 1349075236218599) 
- Direct API architecture (no database caching of campaign data)
- Domain: https://frontend-ten-eta-42.vercel.app

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Basic authentication and Meta OAuth working
- ‚úÖ Simple dashboard with mock data
- ‚úÖ Campaign listing with account selection
- ‚úÖ Edge functions for Meta API calls
- ‚ùå No employee management system
- ‚ùå No role-based permissions
- ‚ùå Limited Meta API data coverage
- ‚ùå Basic UI, not agency-professional
- ‚ùå No admin panel capabilities

**Target User Base:**
- Agency owners (admin role)
- Agency employees (manager/viewer roles)
- Multiple client accounts per agency
- High-volume ad spend management

## Hard Requirements

**Security Requirements:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) must isolate agency data completely
- All API calls must be authenticated and authorised
- Employee access must be granular and auditable
- Meta API credentials must be encrypted at rest

**Performance Requirements:**
- Dashboard must load within 2 seconds
- API responses must complete within 500ms for cached data
- Support minimum 100 concurrent agency users
- Handle 200+ ad accounts per agency efficiently

**Functional Requirements:**
- ALL Meta API insights must be accessible and displayable
- Employee invitation system must work via email
- Role-based permissions must be enforced at database level
- Data export must support CSV and PDF formats
- Interface must be fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)

**Integration Requirements:**
- Direct Meta API integration (no database caching of campaign data)
- Supabase Edge Functions for all external API calls
- Real-time data updates without page refresh
- Webhook support for Meta API change notifications

## Unknowns and Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Current Meta API credentials will remain valid throughout development
- Existing Supabase project can handle the increased database complexity
- Vercel deployment will scale to support multiple agencies
- Users have basic familiarity with Meta Ads Manager interface

**Unknowns to Investigate:**
- Meta API rate limits for high-volume agency usage
- Supabase RLS performance with complex multi-tenant queries
- Email delivery requirements for employee invitations
- White-label branding customisation requirements
- Integration requirements with existing agency tools

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Create database backup and rollback procedures
- Design fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Plan for horizontal scaling if user base grows
