# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Work Status
**Phase 4 Testing Infrastructure: 100% COMPLETE**

All testing infrastructure is operational with 49 tests passing across dashboard components. Ready for final deployment steps to mark Phase 4 as officially complete in production.

## Recent Changes (Last Session)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
1. **InteractiveChart.test.tsx**: 17 tests passing - Perfect reference template
2. **PerformanceComparison.test.tsx**: 14 tests passing - ComposedChart integration verified
3. **MetricBreakdowns.test.tsx**: 18 tests passing - Tabbed interface testing pattern established

### ✅ RESOLVED: Major Technical Issues
- **TypeScript Import Error**: Fixed `import MetricBreakdowns` → `import { MetricBreakdowns }` (named export pattern)
- **Chart Mock Patterns**: Established working Recharts mocking for all chart components
- **Test Expectations**: Corrected to match tabbed interface behavior (only active tab content renders)
- **British Localisation**: All tests verify £ currency and British English throughout

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### 🔍 USER VALIDATION PHASE (NEW PRIORITY)
**User Request**: "Before we go into this phase, I want to go and actually open the embedded website here and I can click stuff to see if we are going in the right direction. For now, we are going to put this new phase before this."

**Development Server ACTIVE**: ✅ http://localhost:3000 (Next.js 14.2.30 running)

**Action Required**: 
1. **Website Review**: User to test current implementation functionality
2. **Validation**: Check if current features work as expected before Phase 4 deployment  
3. **Direction Confirmation**: Ensure we're building the right features for user needs
4. **Local Testing**: User has localhost:3000 (dev) and localhost:9222 (browser) available

### 🚀 DEPLOYMENT ON HOLD (Until after validation)
Phase 4 deployment steps ready but paused per user request:

1. **Git Commit & Push** (ready when approved):
```bash
git add DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md memory-bank/
git commit -m "🚀 Phase 4 Complete: Enterprise Testing Infrastructure + Memory Bank Protocol..."
git push origin main
```

2. **Vercel Production Deployment** (ready when approved):
```bash
cd frontend && npx vercel --prod
```

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Testing Strategy Established
- **Recharts Mocking Pattern**: Consistent across all chart components
- **Named Export Pattern**: All dashboard components use `export function ComponentName`
- **British Standards**: £ currency, British spelling enforced throughout
- **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA labels, tab navigation, keyboard support
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop-first with mobile considerations

### Project Insights & Learnings
- **Direct API Architecture**: Continues to prove simpler than database storage patterns
- **Component Testing**: Tabbed interfaces require understanding of DOM visibility
- **Chart Integration**: Recharts requires careful mocking for reliable testing
- **Professional Standards**: Enterprise-grade testing protects £2M+ ad spend platform

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### 🎯 CRITICAL MEMORY BANK MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**: Every discovery, progress, learning, or change MUST update Memory Bank immediately.

#### Memory Bank Update Triggers (ALWAYS REQUIRED):
- ✅ **Learning Discovery**: Any new technical pattern, solution, or insight
- ✅ **Progress Made**: Any task completion, milestone achievement, or advancement
- ✅ **Project Changes**: Any modification to brief, requirements, or scope
- ✅ **System Patterns**: Any architectural decisions, design patterns, or technical approaches
- ✅ **Tech Context**: Any new tools, dependencies, configurations, or technical constraints
- ✅ **Active Context**: Any current work updates, next steps, or decision changes
- ✅ **Product Context**: Any user experience insights, business requirements, or feature changes

#### Which Files to Update:
- **projectbrief.md**: Core requirements, goals, scope changes
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture, patterns, component relationships
- **techContext.md**: Technologies, dependencies, workflows, constraints
- **activeContext.md**: Current focus, recent work, immediate next steps
- **productContext.md**: User experience, business value, feature requirements
- **progress.md**: Status updates, achievements, evolution timeline

#### Why This Is Mission-Critical:
- **Memory Reset Reality**: Cline's memory resets completely between sessions
- **Context Continuity**: Memory Bank is the ONLY way to maintain project knowledge
- **Efficiency Requirement**: Without proper documentation, every session starts from scratch
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures lessons learned aren't lost and mistakes aren't repeated
- **Project Success**: Direct correlation between Memory Bank quality and project success rate

**RULE**: Before completing any significant work, ask "What did I learn that should be documented?" and update the appropriate Memory Bank files immediately.

### Established Component Patterns
```typescript
// Correct export pattern
export function ComponentName() { ... }

// Correct import pattern  
import { ComponentName } from '../ComponentName'

// Chart mocking pattern
jest.mock('recharts', () => ({
  ResponsiveContainer: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="responsive-container">{children}</div>,
  // ... etc
}))
```

### .clinerules Compliance
- **TEST001-004**: All mandatory testing requirements satisfied
- **EH002**: Git commit/push required (NEVER use git commit/push in tools)
- **FS003**: Professional production deployment standards
- **CS002**: Proper indentation and formatting maintained

## Current Project Architecture

### Working Components (All Tested)
- ✅ **InteractiveChart**: Multi-chart dashboard component with period selection
- ✅ **PerformanceComparison**: Campaign vs benchmark comparison charts
- ✅ **MetricBreakdowns**: Tabbed interface with pie charts for audience/placement/device breakdowns

### Established Infrastructure
- ✅ **Jest Configuration**: Complete TypeScript support
- ✅ **Test Setup**: @testing-library/jest-dom integration
- ✅ **Recharts Mocking**: Reliable pattern for all chart components
- ✅ **British Localisation**: Currency and language standards enforced
