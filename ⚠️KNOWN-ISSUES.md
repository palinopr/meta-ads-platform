## ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCOVERED ISSUES** (In Order of Discovery)

### **Issue #001: Context Loss Between Conversations**
- **Discovered**: Before this session (recurring pattern)
- **Symptoms**: Starting each new conversation without context of previous work
- **Impact**: HIGH - Repeated problem-solving, lost productivity
- **Root Cause**: No persistent memory system across conversation boundaries
- **Solution Status**: ‚úÖ SOLVED - Built comprehensive progress tracking system
- **Prevention**: Use üö®MANDATORY-READ.md at start of every session

### **Issue #002: Progress Not Visible or Tracked**
- **Discovered**: During system design analysis
- **Symptoms**: Unclear what was accomplished, hard to measure velocity
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Reduced motivation, unclear momentum
- **Root Cause**: No real-time progress tracking mechanism
- **Solution Status**: ‚úÖ SOLVED - Created ‚úÖPROGRESS-LOG.md with real-time updates
- **Prevention**: Update progress log after every todo completion

### **Issue #003: Decisions Not Preserved with Rationale**
- **Discovered**: During context engineering analysis
- **Symptoms**: Re-debating same decisions, forgetting why choices were made
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Wasted time, inconsistent decision-making
- **Root Cause**: No systematic decision documentation
- **Solution Status**: ‚úÖ SOLVED - Created üß†DECISION-LOG.md for rationale tracking
- **Prevention**: Log all significant decisions immediately with full context

### **Issue #004: Supabase Edge Function Authentication During Testing**
- **Discovered**: During Meta token encryption deployment testing
- **Symptoms**: Test functions returning 401 authentication errors even with proper headers
- **Impact**: LOW - Testing complexity, but doesn't affect production functionality
- **Root Cause**: Supabase enforces authentication on all edge functions by default
- **Solution Status**: ‚úÖ WORKED AROUND - Used production verification instead of direct testing
- **Prevention**: Plan authentication for testing, or use service role for debug functions

### **Issue #005: Environment Variable Deployment Methods**
- **Discovered**: During META_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY deployment
- **Symptoms**: Uncertainty about CLI vs Dashboard deployment for environment variables
- **Impact**: LOW - Deployment method ambiguity, but CLI method worked successfully
- **Root Cause**: Multiple valid deployment paths for Supabase environment variables
- **Solution Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Supabase CLI `secrets set` command works reliably
- **Prevention**: Document preferred deployment method (CLI) for consistent approach

## üîç **MONITORING AREAS** (Watch for Future Issues)

### **Emoji File Naming Compatibility**
- **Potential Issue**: Emoji prefixes might not work in all environments
- **Symptoms to Watch**: Files not displaying correctly, sorting issues
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Easy to rename if needed
- **Mitigation**: Test in different terminals, IDEs, and operating systems
- **Fallback Plan**: Switch to text prefixes if emoji causes problems

### **Real-Time Update Burden**
- **Potential Issue**: Frequent progress updates might become tedious
- **Symptoms to Watch**: Skipping updates, feeling updates slow down work
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Could break the system if updates stop
- **Mitigation**: Monitor update frequency, adjust if becomes burdensome
- **Optimization**: Could automate some updates in future

### **System Complexity Creep**
- **Potential Issue**: Adding too many files/processes to the system
- **Symptoms to Watch**: System feels overwhelming, adoption decreases
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Complex systems often get abandoned
- **Mitigation**: Keep core system simple, resist feature creep
- **Principle**: Make it easier to follow than ignore

## üìä **PROBLEM PATTERNS**

### **Recurring Issue Types**
1. **Memory/Context Loss**: Most common problem across sessions
2. **Progress Visibility**: Hard to see accomplishments and momentum
3. **Decision Forgetting**: Losing rationale for choices over time

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Primary**: Lack of persistent memory system
- **Secondary**: No forcing functions to maintain good practices
- **Tertiary**: Human tendency to skip documentation under time pressure

### **Prevention Strategies**
- **Systematic approach**: Build systems, not just documentation
- **Forcing functions**: Make good practices easier than bad ones
- **Immediate value**: Tools must help you work faster to be adopted

## üî¨ **DEEP PROBLEM ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

### **MANDATORY Analysis Levels** (NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED)

#### **Level 1: Symptom Identification**
- **What**: Exactly what is happening? (Observable behavior)
- **When**: Under what conditions does it occur?
- **Where**: In which part of the system?
- **Who**: Which users/components are affected?

#### **Level 2: Immediate Cause Analysis**
- **How**: What is directly causing the symptom?
- **Trigger**: What specific action/condition triggers the issue?
- **Path**: What is the failure path through the system?
- **Dependencies**: What components are involved?

#### **Level 3: Root Cause Investigation** (MINIMUM REQUIRED)
- **Why**: Why is the immediate cause occurring?
- **Design**: Is this a design flaw or implementation bug?
- **Environment**: Are environmental factors contributing?
- **Process**: Did a process failure enable this issue?

#### **Level 4: System-Level Understanding** (RECOMMENDED)
- **Patterns**: Is this part of a larger pattern of issues?
- **Architecture**: How does this relate to system architecture?
- **Prevention**: What system changes would prevent this class of issues?
- **Learning**: What does this teach us about our system?

### **Problem-Solving Discipline Rules**

#### **üö´ FORBIDDEN APPROACHES**
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION**: Don't reduce complex problems to simple ones
- **NO SYMPTOM FIXES**: Don't solve symptoms without addressing root causes
- **NO QUICK HACKS**: Don't implement band-aids for systemic issues
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Don't assume you understand without investigation

#### **‚úÖ REQUIRED APPROACHES**
- **DEEP INVESTIGATION**: Always reach Level 3 analysis minimum
- **SYSTEM THINKING**: Consider broader implications
- **ROOT CAUSE FOCUS**: Address underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Capture full analysis for future reference
