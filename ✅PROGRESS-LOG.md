## 🔍 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What's Working Well**
- **Emoji prefixes**: Make files visually distinctive and easy to find
- **TodoWrite integration**: Provides immediate starting points for each session
- **Real-time updates**: Updating this file immediately maintains momentum
- **Forcing functions**: Making it easier to follow than ignore the system

### **What Could Be Improved**
- **File naming**: Consider if emoji prefixes work in all environments
- **Content length**: Balance comprehensiveness with readability
- **Update frequency**: Need to test if real-time updates become burdensome
