# ü§ñ AUTOMATED MANDATORY PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

> **üö® CRITICAL AUTOMATION**: This file defines the automated protocol that MUST execute whenever the user requests reading MANDATORY-CEO-REFERENCE.md. This ensures 100% compliance with the mandatory tracking system.

---

## üéØ **TRIGGER PHRASE RECOGNITION**

### **When User Says ANY of These:**
- `read '/Users/jaimeortiz/meta-ads-platform/üìãMANDATORY-CEO-REFERENCE.md'`
- `check CEO priorities`
- `read CEO reference`
- `what are the current CEO priorities`

### **AUTOMATIC RESPONSE REQUIRED:**
Execute the complete 3-phase automated protocol below ‚¨áÔ∏è

---

## üìã **PHASE 1: MANDATORY PRE-WORK READING** (BEFORE ANY WORK)

### **Step 1: Complete File Reading Sequence**
Read these files in EXACT order (DO NOT SKIP ANY):

1. üö®**MANDATORY-READ.md** - Current system state and startup commands
2. üìã**MANDATORY-CEO-REFERENCE.md** - CEO priorities and business impact  
3. üìç**CURRENT-SESSION.md** - Last session context and focus
4. üöß**BLOCKERS.md** - Known issues and landmines to avoid
5. ‚úÖ**PROGRESS-LOG.md** - Recent accomplishments and momentum
6. üß†**DECISION-LOG.md** - Previous decisions and rationale
7. üìà**MOMENTUM-TRACKER.md** - Energy and focus patterns
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è**KNOWN-ISSUES.md** - Problem history and solutions
9. üîç**CONTEXT-CHECK.md** - Last major change validation

### **Step 2: Automatic TodoWrite Generation**
Create TodoWrite list based on CEO priorities discovered:

```json
[
  {"id": "1", "content": "Current CEO Priority: [EXTRACTED FROM CEO-REFERENCE]", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"},
  {"id": "2", "content": "Verify production status at https://frontend-ten-eta-42.vercel.app", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"},
  {"id": "3", "content": "Assess business impact alignment with $2M+ revenue priorities", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"},
  {"id": "4", "content": "[SPECIFIC NEXT ACTION FROM CEO PRIORITIES]", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"}
]
```

### **Step 3: System State Assessment**
Confirm understanding by stating:
- **Current CEO Priority**: [PRIORITY FROM REFERENCE FILE]
- **Business Impact**: [REVENUE/CUSTOMER/GROWTH RISK]
- **Completion Status**: [PERCENTAGE AND NEXT ACTION]
- **Active Blockers**: [ANY ISSUES THAT PREVENT PROGRESS]
